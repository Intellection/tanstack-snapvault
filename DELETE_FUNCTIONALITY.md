- **Thumbnails**: Associated thumbnail files also removed
- **Access Logs**: Maintains audit trail even after deletion

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Failures**: Partial success in batch operations reported clearly
- **File Not Found**: Handles missing files without breaking the operation
- **Permission Errors**: Clear error messages for access denied scenarios
- **Network Issues**: Proper error handling for API failures

## üé® User Interface

### File List Enhancements
- **Delete Button**: Individual trash icon for each file
- **Visual States**: Hover effects, disabled states for expired files
- **Loading States**: Spinner and disabled buttons during operations
- **Success Feedback**: Clear success/error messages

### Confirmation Modal
- **Professional Design**: Clean, modern modal with proper animations
- **Clear Warning**: Emphasizes permanent nature of deletion
- **File Count**: Shows exact number of files being deleted
- **Loading State**: Shows progress during deletion process
- **Cancel Option**: Easy way to abort the operation

### Batch Operations
- **Selection Counter**: Shows "X files selected"
- **Bulk Actions**: Delete Selected and Download Selected buttons
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of selected files
- **Smart Disabling**: Buttons disabled when no files selected

## üì° API Endpoints

### DELETE /api/files/delete
**Purpose**: Delete a single file
**Method**: DELETE
**Authentication**: Required
**Rate Limit**: 10 requests per 10 minutes

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "fileId": "uuid-string"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "File deleted successfully",
  "fileId": "uuid-string"
}
```

### POST /api/files/delete
**Purpose**: Delete multiple files in batch
**Method**: POST
**Authentication**: Required
**Rate Limit**: 3 requests per 15 minutes
**Max Files**: 20 per request

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "fileIds": ["uuid-1", "uuid-2", "uuid-3"]
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "results": [
    {
      "fileId": "uuid-1",
      "success": true,
      "fileName": "document.pdf"
    },
    {
      "fileId": "uuid-2",
      "success": false,
      "error": "File not found"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total": 2,
    "successful": 1,
    "failed": 1
  }
}
```

## üîç Monitoring & Analytics

### Access Logging
All deletion attempts are logged with:
- File ID and user ID
- IP address (hashed for privacy)
- User agent (truncated)
- Action type (`file_deleted`, `batch_file_deleted`, etc.)
- Success/failure status
- Error details if applicable
- Timestamp

### Security Dashboard Integration
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Shows deletion activities
- **Suspicious Activity**: Detects unusual deletion patterns
- **Statistics**: Tracks deletion rates and success rates
- **Alerts**: Notifications for suspicious bulk deletions

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

### Efficient Batch Processing
- **Sequential Processing**: Processes files one by one to avoid overwhelming the system
- **Error Isolation**: One failed deletion doesn't stop the entire batch
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed results for each file in the batch
- **Memory Management**: Minimal memory footprint during large batch operations

### Database Efficiency
- **Single Transactions**: Each deletion is atomic
- **Index Usage**: Optimized queries using file ID index
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management
- **Cleanup Integration**: Integrated with existing cleanup routines

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### Frontend Components
- **FileList.tsx**: Enhanced with delete functionality
- **Delete Modal**: Custom confirmation component
- **State Management**: React hooks for selection and loading states
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and retry options

### Backend Services
- **delete/route.ts**: API endpoint implementation
- **file-utils.ts**: File system operations
- **secure-access.ts**: Security and logging functions
- **database.ts**: Database operations

### CSS & Animations
- **Modal Animations**: Smooth slide-up animation for confirmation modal
- **Loading Spinners**: Visual feedback during operations
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive button states
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
